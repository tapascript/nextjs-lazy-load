        In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike 🦮, known
        as &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Butch&quot; in some shorts, an angry, vicious but easily
        duped bulldog who tries to attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke
        while trying to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute, aside
        from howls and biting noises as well as attacking indiscriminately, not
        caring whether it was Tom or Jerry though usually attacking Tom.

        later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions,
        performed by Billy Bletcher and later Daws Butler, modeled after
        comedian Jimmy Durante. Spike&apos;s coat has altered throughout the years
        between gray and creamy tan. The addition of Spike&apos;s son Tyke in the
        late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike&apos;s character and a
        short-lived spin-off theatrical series called Spike and Tyke.
