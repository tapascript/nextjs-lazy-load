        Jerry 🐀, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in his debut appearance,
        is a small, brown house mouse who always lives in close proximity to
        Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no
        match for Jerry&apos;s wits. Jerry possesses surprising strength for his
        size, approximately the equivalent of Tom&apos;s, lifting items such as
        anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts.

      <p className="text-xl my-1">
        Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom
        to actually try to eat Jerry. He tries to hurt or compete with him just
        to taunt Jerry, even as revenge, or to obtain a reward from a human,
        including his owner(s)/master(s), for catching Jerry, or for generally
        doing his job well as a house cat. By the final &quot;fade-out&quot; of each
        cartoon, Jerry usually gets the best of Tom.
